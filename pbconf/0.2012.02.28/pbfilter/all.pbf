filter PBDESC_libdataseries_raw = DataSeries shared library                      \
 DataSeries is a library for efficient access to serial structured data.         \
 The C++ shared library is required by all programs that use DataSeries.         \
 This package should probably never be directly installed but instead only       \
 as a dependency of some other package.

filter PBDESC_dataseries_utils_raw = Utilities to manipulate/import to/export from DataSeries files \
 The DataSeries utilities are the programs that either a) operate on DataSeries  \
 files, e.g. calculating various statistics, selecting a subset of a file,       \
 converting the compression type in the files; b) convert some input source      \
 file into DataSeries, e.g. comma separated values, or lsf accounting files, or  \
 pcap network traces into DataSeries files; c) convert some input DataSeries     \
 file into some other format, for example, into text, or comma separated         \
 values, or back into the original input format for reversable conversions; or   \
 d) perform some analysis on the dataseries files, e.g. calculating statistics   \
 on packet arrival rates, or calculating mean LSF cluster utilization.  These    \
 utilities are likely to be the package that end users want to install, and if   \
 they want to then write a custom analysis the libdataseries-dev package.  If    \
 lintel-utils is also installed then the batch-parallel modules can be used for  \
 bulk processing.

filter PBDESC_libdataseries_dev_doc_raw = DataSeries development documentation  \
 This package contains all of the documentation for libdataseries-dev, mostly   \
 the auto-generated doxygen documentation.  This package is only useful if you  \
 have already installed libdataseries-dev since without that package, the       \
 documentation in this one covers nothing that is installed.

filter PBDESC_libdataseries_dev_raw = DataSeries development include files and link library \
 DataSeries is a library for efficient access to serial structured data.                    \
 Serial structured data is roughly tabular, i.e. typed columns that are                     \
 accessed sequentially.  The development libraries are necessary for writing                \
 new DataSeries programs, but not for accessing existing DataSeries programs as             \
 those can be found in dataseries-utils.
